Thank you for downloading my mod.
Here are some quick instructions for setting up and playing this mod.

Setup:
Place the pokemon folder in this directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2".
Place the provided shortcut on your desktop.

How to Play:
First, please use the give all command to gain access to all necessary weapons.
The blaster will be used to target enemies with your pokemon.
Grenades (Pokeballs) spawn a pokemon which can be recalled by hitting it with another pokeball.
Pokemon and monsters alike have types, to see their types use the rocket launcher and shoot them to display a message.
Using the shotgun on your pokemon will cause it to use its 1st move.
Using the blaster will use the 2nd move.
Using the railgun will trigger a 3rd move.
