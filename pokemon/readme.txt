Thank you for downloading my mod.
Here are some quick instructions for setting up and playing this mod.

Setup:
Place the pokemon folder in this directory "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Quake 2".
Place the provided shortcut on your desktop.
Download and unpack the pak0.zip, placing it in the pokemon folder.

How to Play:
First, please use the give all command to gain access to all necessary weapons.

The blaster will be used to target enemies with your pokemon.

Grenades (Pokeballs) spawn a pokemon which can be recalled by hitting it with another pokeball.

Pokemon and monsters alike have types, to see their types use the rocket launcher and shoot them to display a message.

To have your pokemon use their moves you must target them with your weapons.

Shooting them with your blaster, shotgun, super shotgun and grenade launcher will cause them to use their 1st, 2nd, 3rd and 4th moves respectively.

Moves have names and types that will display in the console when used

Type effectiveness matters some moves are more effective against other types. (Standard Pokemon type conventions)

To help you become a pokemon master you can have your pokemon lock onto enemies by prodding your pokemon with your hyperblaster.

That will make connecting attacks much easier.
